# The Script Lab

A curated collection of PowerShell scripts for everyday administration, automation, and security testing. The project gathers standalone utilities created over time and organizes them by purpose.

## Project Purpose

The repository serves as a central catalogue of scripts that can assist with infrastructure management, DevOps tasks, and penetration testing. Some scripts simplify routine maintenance while others demonstrate security techniques. Use the security scripts responsibly and only in environments where you have permission to test.

## Directory Overview

- **API** – Utilities for working with web APIs, including authentication helpers and endpoint testing scripts.
- **Development** – Experimental or in-progress scripts used for development and debugging.
- **Docker** – Helpers for container troubleshooting such as log readers and processing-time measurements.
- **Eve-Online** – Scripts built around the EVE Online game for data collection and network diagnostics.
- **Maintenence-Testing** – System clean‑up tools and connectivity tests.
- **Misc** – Various administration scripts like inventory gathering and log maintenance.
- **Pen-Test** – Scripts intended for penetration testing (e.g., brute force examples and network probes). Use these responsibly.
- **SSL** – Certificate management and hashing utilities.
- **Tooling** – General‑purpose tools including DNS checkers, QR generators, and web scanners.

## Setup Notes

Most scripts are written for Windows PowerShell. Clone the repository and run scripts individually as needed. Review each file for prerequisites such as installed modules or required permissions.

## Requesting New Scripts

We welcome contributions. Open a GitHub issue describing your request or contact the maintainers directly with ideas for new scripts. Pull requests are also encouraged.
