.SYNOPSIS
    A simple keylogger script that logs key presses to a specified file.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script sets the execution policy to bypass for the current session, 
    adds the necessary .NET assembly for Windows Forms, and logs key presses 
    to a specified file. It continuously checks for key presses and logs them 
    along with any modifier keys pressed.

.PARAMETER logfile
    The path to the file where key presses will be logged.

.NOTES
