.SYNOPSIS
    This script pings a specified IP address and logs the results to a file for further inspection.

.DESCRIPTION
    The script prompts the user to enter an IP address and verifies its format. It then asks for a path to save the log file, defaulting to the current directory if none is provided. The script performs a ping test to the specified IP address, calculates the average response time, and logs the results with detailed information including timestamp, IP address, status, and ping details.

.PARAMETER ipAddress
    The IP address to ping, entered by the user.

.PARAMETER logPath
    The path where the ping log file will be saved. If not provided, the log file will be saved in the current directory with the name "ping_log.txt".

.EXAMPLE
    PS> .\ping-logger.ps1
    Enter the IP address you want to ping: 8.8.8.8
    Enter the path to save the ping log file (or press Enter for current directory):
    Performing ping test...
    Ping Result saved to log file, txt file should be in same directory - attach to ticket for inspection 'C:\path\to\current\directory\ping_log.txt'
